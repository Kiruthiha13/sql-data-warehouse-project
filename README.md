# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Portfolio Project** repository!

This project exemplifies a complete data warehousing and analytics lifecycle, from warehouse development to the extraction of meaningful insights, adhering to industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## üßÆ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Delivers data structured in a star schema, tailored for business reporting and analytical workflows.

## üìå Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

  ## üîç Project Requirements
